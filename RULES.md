"Igel Ã„rgern" is a German board game, sometimes translated with "hedgehogs in
a hurry". It is played by two to six players on a board with six lanes.
Each player has four pieces depicting hedgehogs.
The objective is to be the first to bring three of the
four hedgehogs into the finish line.

# The Board

The board consists of six lanes in North-South direction, numbered from 1 to 6.
Each lane is nine fields long, including the starting and goal fields.

All pieces start at the southern edge, and race towards the goal line in the North.

Each lane has one tar pit instead of a normal field.

# Start

At the start of the game, each player may place a piece on one of the start
positions, possibly on top of other pieces. He must keep the height difference
of the stacks in the starting line minimal, except when that would force him
to put a piece directly on top of another one of his pieces.


# Rules

Each player in turn rolls a six-sided die. Then he has the option to move one of his movable pieces one neighboring lane to the West or East (for example from lane 3 to lane 2 or 4), and then he must move a piece (not necessarily of his own) on the lane with the number that the dice shows. This piece is moved forward by one field.

Pieces can share the same field by virtue of landing on top of another piece
or stack of pieces. Only the topmost piece on a field is movable.

Pieces on a tar pit are only movable if all other pieces (except those sharing
the same tarpit) have already passed it, i.e. are North of the tar pit.

# Rule variations

There are many variations of the standard rules. Some of them are:

* the first piece to reach the finish line is disqualified (assumed doping)
* instead of single pieces, whole stacks can be moved forward (but never sideways)
* if a player can't move one of his own pieces sideways, he can instead chose a
  stack in which one of his own pieces is contained. He can then move the
  bottom-most piece from that stack to the top.
* each player gets a spare die, and rolls it before the start of the game.
  Whenever he rolls with the regular die, he can chose whether to use the
  number that the regular die shows, or instead the one that the spare die
  shows. If he choses the latter, his spare die must be turned to show the
  number that the regular die showed.
* cylindric board: sideway jumps from line 1 to 6 (and vice versa) are allowed
* additional winning condition: when one piece has reached the goal, and
  all other pieces from that player are inside a tar pit, the player has won.
* repelling tar pits: whenever a piece enters a tar pit, it is immediately
  moved to the starting position on that lane
* shallow tarpit: a tar pit only keeps the lowest piece of a stack, all
  other pieces of the stack can move freely
